When choosing a framework for your web application, it is crucial to take into account the developer experience that it offers. The frameworks built on React and provide a more streamlined experience are Astro, Remix, and Next.js. All three have a low learning curve, so if you are already familiar with React, you can easily and quickly get started with them.

## What is Astro?

![Astro](/images/astro.webp)

Astro is a modern web framework built on React and a static site builder that requires little or no JavaScript to deliver lightning-fast, high-performance websites with a modern developer experience. It allows you to create websites using UI components from your favorite JavaScript UI frameworks such as React, Svelte, Vue, and others.

Astro websites are completely static and do not contain any JavaScript code. However, if a specific component such as an image carousel or dark and light mode requires JavaScript code to function, Astro will only load that particular component along with any necessary dependencies. This ensures that the rest of the website remains lightweight and static in terms of HTML. For a great introduction to Astro, check out their getting started tutorial.

- Astro is more flexible: you can build UI with any popular component library (React, Preact, Vue, Svelte, Solid, and others) or Astro’s HTML-like component syntax, similar to HTML + JSX.
- Astro can build statically via SSG or deploy to SSR environments via adapters: Deno, Vercel serverless, Netlify serverless, and Node.js, with more to come.

## What is Next.js?

Next.js is an open-source React framework for quickly creating server-rendered React applications. It adds structure and features and handles the React tooling and configuration required for your application.

Next.js is a development framework that can be useful for solving common application needs such as routing, data retrieval, and integrations. It was designed to simplify the development process of creating server-side rendered web applications, while providing an improved experience for both developers and end-users. If you're interested in using this framework, the documentation is a great resource to get started.

## What is Remix?

Remix is an edge native, full-stack JavaScript framework for building modern, fast, and resilient user experiences. It simplifies web development with standardization, enabling you to focus on your product instead of code. (source: remix.run)

## Key Features

### Astro

- Zero-config: Any config explained will be handled by our astro add CLI command (i.e., add Svelte support with astro add svelte).

- Astro is UI-agnostic: meaning you can Bring Your Own UI Framework (BYOF).

- An Astro website can load 40% faster with 90% less JavaScript than a React web framework-based site.

- Server-first: Astro leverages server-side rendering over client-side rendering as much as possible

- Astro is a web framework that includes all the necessary features to build a website. It offers a component syntax, file-based routing, asset handling, a build process, bundling, optimizations, data fetching, and more. With Astro, you can easily build great websites without needing to use any additional tools or features outside of its core functionality.

### Remix

- Remix, like other frameworks, offers developers the ability to manage various routes within their web projects. This is achieved through the use of JavaScript or TypeScript files that contain handler functions. By generating routes, we can create files on our website that follow the file system hierarchy of our projects, thus creating analog URLs for our pages. Remix routes work by using the partial routing feature provided by React-Router.

- Nested components: Remix allows you to manage nested pages and components. We can create a file to handle a certain route and, at the same level in the file system, a folder with the same name. All the files we create inside that folder will be nested components of the parent route instead of different pages.

- Forms: As Remix focuses on web standards, it uses native methods (POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH) to handle forms instead of using JavaScript for that.

- Remix provides two types of server-side functions to create dynamic content: Loader functions handle GET HTTP requests to retrieve data from different sources, while Action functions handle POST HTTP requests to modify data on the server.

### Next

- Async Components & Data Fetching: Async components are a new technique for obtaining data for server-rendered components introduced in Next.js 13. We can render async components using Promises with async and await.

- React Server Components: Server components enable us to execute and render React components on the server side, resulting in faster delivery, a smaller JavaScript bundle, and lower client-side rendering costs.

- `app/` Directory for File-Based Routing(Beta): Routes can be specified using the structure of your project directory. Simply place an entry point in the pages directory and create a new route.

- Lightning Fast Bundling: Introduced with Next.js 13 is a new JavaScript bundler, Turbopack billed as the “successor to Webpack.” Be aware that Turbopack is currently in alpha and not production ready.

- Built-in CSS and Sass support: Support for any CSS-in-JS library

## Hydration

Hydration is a technique in client-side JavaScript that can transform a static HTML page into a dynamic page. This technique enhances the user experience by displaying a rendered component on the page which has attached event handlers. Hydration takes place before the user interacts with the static page. If not utilized, it can adversely affect the user experience.

### Astro

Astro uses a technique called partial hydration to load specific components only when necessary while keeping the rest of the page as static HTML. This approach is known as partial hydration. Island design plays an important role in this process by encouraging small, incremental interactions.

- Comparing Next.js vs. Astro Performance Section titled Comparing Next.js vs. Astro Performance in most cases, Astro websites will load significantly faster than Next.js websites.

- Astro automatically strips unnecessary JavaScript from the page, hydrating only the individual components that need it.

- This creates a slower page load and worse performance for your website.

### Next.js

Next.js does not allow partial hydration either. There is experimental support for non-JavaScript webpages in Next.js but none for hydrating components.

- Next.js does not support partial hydration and therefore requires the user to load and rehydrate the entire page in the browser, even if most of the page content is static.

- Next.js has experimental support for fully-static, zero-JavaScript pages.

- However, the website doesn’t show support for hydrating individual components.

### Remix

Remix does not support partial hydration, meaning that it does not allow for server-side rendering of only a portion of a web page. While there are assumptions that Remix will function with the new React 18 suspense features, this is not the case for partial hydration.

## Loading Speed

### Astro

Astro is a fast website builder that is specifically optimized for speed. Its island architecture strategy helps to improve search engine optimization by ranking higher on on-site search engines. It provides a great user experience and reduces the amount of boilerplate code needed. Astro supports most CSS libraries and frameworks, making it an ideal choice for styling support.

### Remix

Remix uses parallel loading of data on the server to speed up data retrieval. This makes it possible for Remix to prerender pages on the server through its support for server-side rendering. On the other hand, Astro delivers a statically-bundled HTML file with minimal or no JavaScript, in contrast to Remix.

## Why the Remix rewrite is fast?

- Instead of caching documents with SSG or SWR, this version caches data at the edge in Redis.
- Quick image optimization Resource Route that writes to a persistent volume.

Why the Remix port is fast?

- Remix doesn’t support SSG, so we used the HTTP stale-while-revalidate caching directive (SWR, not to be confused with Vercel’s SWR client fetching package).

- The result is the same: a static document at the edge (even on the same CDN, Vercel’s). The difference is how the documents get there. Instead of fetching all the data and rendering the pages to static documents at build/deploy time, the cache is primed when you get traffic.

-Documents are served from the cache and revalidated in the background for the next visitor.

### Next.js

Next.js boasts of its server-side rendering and static builds features. Next.Js also includes several pre-built techniques for data retrieval.

Why Next.js is fast?

- The homepage uses Static Site Generation (SSG) with getStaticProps.

- At build time, Next.js pulls data from Shopify, renders a page to an HTML file and puts it in the public directory.

- When the site is deployed, the static file is served at the edge (out of Vercel’s CDN) instead of hitting an origin server at a single location.

- When a request comes in, the CDN serves the file.

- Data loading and rendering have already been done ahead of time, so the visitor doesn’t pay the download + render cost.

## Wrapping Up

We reviewed three JavaScript libraries: Astro, Remix, and Next.js. Next.js has several data fetching methods such as ISR, CSR, SSG, and SSR.

We evaluated various frameworks based on their key features, loading speed, hydration, server-side rendering, and ease of use. This enables you to select the best framework for your project by considering which one solves your problem most effectively, rather than which one is superior.
