When discussing code reviews, the emphasis is often on the reviewer. However, the role of the developer who writes the code is equally significant in the review process. Unfortunately, limited guidance is available on preparing your code for review, often leading to authors making mistakes due to a lack of knowledge.

This article provides tips for authors on effectively participating in a code review. By the end of this post, you will have gained enough knowledge to send out your code for review like a pro and impress your reviewer.

### Why do code reviews?

Code reviews serve several vital purposes in software development:

1. Bug detection is a crucial part of software development. Code reviews are an effective way to identify bugs, logic errors, and other issues in the code before they reach production. By catching mistakes that the original developer might have missed, code reviews lead to higher quality and more reliable software.

2. Code reviews allow developers to share their expertise and learn from each other. Through code reviews, reviewers can suggest improvements, introduce new techniques and best practices, and promote collaboration within the team. This process also facilitates knowledge sharing across the organization.

3. Code reviews are essential to maintain a high level of code quality and consistency across the codebase. By adhering to coding standards, best practices, and design patterns, reviewers can ensure that the codebase is readable, maintainable, and complies with established guidelines.

4. Code reviews create a culture of continuous improvement by fostering constructive feedback, refining coding skills, enhancing project understanding, and identifying areas for code enhancement.

5. Team building and accountability are two important factors that are encouraged through code reviews. Code reviews foster collaboration and teamwork within the development team, allowing developers to review each other's work and provide feedback. This creates a shared responsibility for the codebase and helps to establish a sense of accountability. Developers are held responsible for the quality and reliability of their code, which helps to ensure a higher level of code quality overall.

Code reviews improve software quality, developer skills, and process efficiency.

### How to comment on the code?

Code commenting is a crucial practice that improves code readability, maintainability, and understanding. These are some guidelines for effective commenting:

1. Use Clear and Concise Comments: Write comments that are easy to understand and concise. Avoid ambiguous or vague comments that can lead to confusion. Comment only where necessary and focus on explaining the intent or purpose of the code.

2. Comment Purpose and High-Level Logic: Comment on the overall purpose and functionality of the code block or function. Explain the high-level logic and any important decisions made during the implementation. This helps other developers understand the code’s intent without diving into the implementation details.

3. Document Complex or Non-Obvious Code: If the code contains complex algorithms, non-trivial logic, or intricate business rules, provide comments to explain how it works. This helps other developers, including your future self, comprehend the code more easily.

4. Use Self-Explanatory Variable and Function Names: Naming variables and functions descriptively can eliminate the need for excessive comments. When code is self-explanatory, it becomes easier to understand without relying heavily on comments.

5. Comment Tricky or Non-Standard Code: If you encounter code that deviates from standard practices or uses workarounds, provide comments explaining why. This helps prevent others from mistakenly considering it as an error or making unnecessary changes.

6. Update Comments with Code Changes: When you modify code, update the corresponding comments to reflect the changes accurately. Outdated comments can be misleading and confusing.

7. Avoid Redundant Comments: Avoid commenting on obvious code or duplicating information already apparent from the code itself. Redundant comments can clutter the code and make it harder to read.

8. Use Comment Styles Consistently: Follow consistent comment styles and formatting conventions throughout the codebase. This helps maintain a unified and organized appearance.

Remember that comments should complement the code and provide valuable information that enhances understanding. Well-placed and meaningful comments can significantly improve the readability and maintainability of your codebase.

### How can it help me as a developer to do code reviews of other developers?

Performing code reviews of other developers’ work can significantly benefit you as a developer in several ways:

1. Enhancing Code Quality: Code reviews provide an opportunity to identify and address potential issues, bugs, or inefficiencies in the codebase. By reviewing other developers’ code, you can catch mistakes or suggest improvements, leading to higher code quality.

2. Learning Opportunities: Code reviews expose you to different coding styles, techniques, and problem-solving approaches. You can learn from the strengths and weaknesses of others’ code, gaining insights into new patterns, best practices, and innovative solutions.

3. Collaboration and Teamwork: Code reviews promote collaboration and foster a sense of shared responsibility within the development team. Through the review process, you can engage in constructive discussions, share knowledge, and work together to improve the overall codebase.

4. Consistency and Standards: Code reviews help maintain consistency and adherence to coding standards across the project. By reviewing code, you can ensure that the codebase follows established guidelines, naming conventions, formatting rules, and other project-specific requirements.

5. Knowledge Sharing: Code reviews facilitate knowledge sharing among team members. As you review the code, you can provide explanations, suggest alternative approaches, and offer guidance. This knowledge-sharing benefits both the developer whose code is being reviewed and the reviewer.

6. Identifying Patterns and Anti-patterns: Code reviews allow you to identify recurring patterns or anti-patterns in the codebase. By recognizing such patterns, you can propose refactoring opportunities, suggest code reuse, or identify areas where design patterns can be applied.

7. Error Prevention: Code reviews are a preventive measure against introducing bugs or issues into the codebase. By thoroughly reviewing code, you can identify potential pitfalls, evaluate edge cases, and spot logic errors before they reach the production environment.

8. Continuous Improvement: Code reviews promote a culture of continuous improvement within the development team. By providing constructive feedback and suggestions, you contribute to the growth of individual developers and the overall team’s skills.

Participating in code reviews can improve development culture, skills and the codebase quality.

### How should I do code reviews? How to learn it?

To effectively conduct code reviews, consider the following steps and tips:

1. Set clear expectations: Establish guidelines and standards for code reviews within your team or organization. Define the goals of code reviews, the scope of review, and the expected timeline.

2. Review the code independently: Start by examining the code alone, without any distractions. Understand the purpose, functionality, and design choices made in the code.

3. Follow a checklist: Use a checklist or predefined criteria to ensure thoroughness and consistency in your code reviews. This can include code style, readability, performance, security, error handling, and adherence to best practices. For example, check for [code smells](https://refactoring.guru/refactoring/smells) and then resolve them using [refactoring techniques](https://refactoring.guru/refactoring/techniques).

4. Provide constructive feedback: When you identify areas for improvement, offer clear and specific feedback. Explain the issues you’ve found and suggest possible solutions or alternative approaches.

5. Prioritize and categorize feedback: Differentiate between critical issues that need immediate attention and minor suggestions for improvement. Organize your feedback to help the developer understand the importance and impact of each comment.

6. Be objective and impartial: Focus on the quality of the code and adherence to established standards rather than personal preferences. Base your feedback on objective criteria and best practices.

7. Balance between nitpicking and high-level feedback: While it’s essential to catch minor issues, also provide feedback on the overall design, architecture, and problem-solving approach. Find the right balance between detailed suggestions and high-level guidance.

8. Foster collaboration and learning: Code reviews should be seen as growth and knowledge-sharing opportunities. Encourage open discussions, ask questions, and be receptive to different perspectives. Promote a culture of continuous learning and improvement.

9. Document your feedback: Keep a record of the input you provide through comments in the code review tool or in a separate document. This helps track progress and allows developers to refer back to the feedback.

10. Learn from others: Participate in code reviews of your peers and learn from their feedback. Observe how experienced reviewers provide suggestions and explanations. Seek feedback on your code to enhance your skills and understanding.

You can become an influential code reviewer by following these steps and continuously learning and practicing from the experience.
