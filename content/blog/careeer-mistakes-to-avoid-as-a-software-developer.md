Life is full of ups and downs, twists and turns, but it is through these experiences that we find opportunities to progress and grow. Whether it be in our personal or professional lives, through work or education, there are endless chances to learn and improve. Embrace the journey and all that it has to offer.

Building a successful career is not an easy feat. There are many factors that come into play. While some of these factors are beyond our control, we can definitely avoid mistakes and make better decisions to steer our career in the right direction. Let's work together to build a bright future!

### 1. You don’t set realistic goals

One of the biggest mistakes most of us make in our careers is not having a goal. What exactly is a goal? It is something like a target.

Usually, we have a lot of short-term goals, for example,

- I have to fix this bug today.
- I have to build this project this week.
- I have to get a promotion this year.

These are great goals to have. But we need to have long-term goals as well. Like, what do you want to be in the long-term in your career? How do you plan every step to achieve that goal?

You may ask, will I be able to fulfill all the goals in my life? Well, maybe not. Still, having some and prioritizing the most important ones is important. That way, even if you can’t achieve some, you may identify a few more new goals.

You may have a different way of going about it. But, if you don’t have a starting point, you have nothing to work toward and chase. Your career may become stagnant.

If you don’t have any career goals right now, take some time to come up with a couple of realistic goals.

### 2. You don’t take the time to network

Let's talk about socializing instead of computer networking and focus on human-to-human interactions.

Networking and socializing with people who share your interests, communicating with them, and drawing inspiration from their work are just as important as learning to code when it comes to programming. You may be an excellent programmer and a skilled coder, but if you work in isolation, nobody will know about your capabilities and potential. Therefore, you might miss out on greater career opportunities.

When you engage in socializing and networking with other individuals in the tech industry, you may discover a valuable community to become a part of. This community will provide you with an opportunity to converse about significant topics with like-minded people who share similar interests as yours. This interaction can assist you in multiplying your growth by several folds.

### 3. You are wasting your precious time

Not utilizing time effectively is known as wasting time. Proper time management can greatly benefit both your career and personal life, since time is a precious resource.

To clarify, watching a movie, going out with your friends and family, participating in festive activities, and so are not wasting time. You need these to balance out the time you spend working.

Rather, I’m more concerned about the tasks you may have to perform that take away from your “focus time” at work.

To avoid finding yourself in difficult situations, it is important to use your time wisely. If you have a task to complete, it is best to complete it promptly. Procrastination can lead to a delay in completing other tasks that depend on the completion of the initial task, resulting in a cycle of wasted time, frustration, and complex situations.

### 4. You only focus on the Money

Come on, money is important. But it's not the only thing to consider when changing jobs or pursuing career goals.

When you are considering changing your job, it's essential to assess other factors like the work environment, the amount of time you would be expected to spend in the office, the level of stress you would be subjected to, and whether the salary and benefits package are worth it. All these considerations should be taken into account to ensure that the job switch is the right decision for you.

I would certainly look into the following factors along with the compensation (the money part) to make an informed decision about my job switching:

- What will be my technical growth and learning opportunities?
- What will the work environment be like? Remote/Work From Office/Hybrid? How will that impact me?
- What skills (both tech and soft) will I be able to learn in the new position?
- What kind of employee benefits will I get compared to my current organization?
- Will my work-life balance be impacted positively?
- What are the company’s vision, culture, and values?

When considering a job offer, it's common for people to focus their attention solely on the salary offered. However, it's important to conduct thorough research and gather information about other benefits or incentives the company may be providing in addition to the salary. Talking to someone who works there can also be helpful. It's crucial to remember that the salary alone should not be the only factor to base your decision on.

### 5. You neglect work-life balance

Another mistake you might make is not balancing your work and life. The last thing you want is to burn out at the cost of things you love the most, like your friends, family, and long-term career.

Learning to prioritize things is crucial, and this should involve both work and personal life. Your daily priority list should not comprise solely of work-related items. While it is important to fix bugs, it is equally essential to attend your kids' soccer games or school plays, make time for a date with your partner, or do something nice for yourself.

Do not be afraid to say “No”. At the same time, don’t be arrogant when you accept or decline tasks. This is important to keep a healthy work-life balance. When you already have plenty on your plate, trying to accommodate more or do more will only spill over and negatively affect your work-life balance.

Our habits can sometimes cause us to experience an imbalance between our work and personal lives. For instance, staying late at the office when the same work could be completed the following day is a typical example of a habit that can lead to health problems and long-term frustration.

It's important for all of us to strike a balance between work and personal life. To achieve this, it's best to plan ahead and stick to a schedule as much as possible. While there may be situations where one aspect of life needs more attention than the other, it's important not to make those exceptions a regular occurrence.

### 6. You cannot see the bigger picture

As developers, we’re supposed to implement features, do bug fixes, maintain code, and deliver quality software to our end-users. That’s great!

We must broaden our thinking beyond the individual tasks that have been assigned to us. It is crucial to have a clear understanding of the overall project goals, user acceptance criteria, delivery mechanisms, and the perspective of other engineers. Additionally, it is important to evaluate the impact of our work in order to obtain a comprehensive view of the project.

Missing the bigger picture may lead to a lack of synergy in your organization. It can also result in software products that need multiple iterations to meet customer needs because those needs weren’t understood at the beginning. This can cause you to miss deadlines and do more work, and can greatly increase the cost to your client.

It is important to consider the impact of your work on both end users and internal customers, regardless of the size or significance of the project. This includes individuals such as product/project managers, quality assurance teams, and documentation teams.

Once you look at the bigger picture and act accordingly, your margin of error reduces automatically.

### Conclusion

I want to share some career advice based on my personal experience. Before moving on to my next article, here's a quick tip: focus on building your finances.

Attaining financial independence leads to a feeling of tranquility and security that provides you with the freedom to explore career prospects. However, achieving financial stability is a gradual process that necessitates thoughtful planning, intelligent saving, and astute investing to guarantee that your wealth grows faster than your age.
