![React Roadmap 2024](/images/react-roadmap-2024.webp)

In this guide, I will provide a complete roadmap and cover all that can help you become a React developer in 2024.

Below is the roadmap that I recommend for React developers - whether you are a newbie or an advanced developer - to help you build impressive applications, land a job, and enjoy working with React.

## Core React Concepts

There are several fundamental React concepts that are essential for building any React application, regardless of its complexity.

The most significant concept in React is components. In 2024, almost every component you make will be a function component.

These components are composed of React elements and JSX. Understanding the behavior of JSX is essential, as well as passing data to components using props and knowing the difference between props and state. Finally, learning how to render parts of the user interface with conditional rendering conditionally is also vital.

## Hooks

After the core concepts of React, you have the built-in React Hooks. The most important and frequently used of these are useState, useEffect, useRef, and useContext.

To use these hooks, you will need to understand the basics of React state, how to perform a side effect with useEffect, and avoid the potential pitfalls of useEffect, such as infinite loops.

You’ll need also to understand refs for the useRef hook. And the context API for useContext.

Again, these are what you’re going to use probably 90% of the time. The other 10% or so might be custom hooks that you make to add unique functionality to your application.

## Intermediate React Concepts

To really master React, you need to have a solid grasp of some intermediate concepts.

Some of these intermediate concepts include:

"Please remember the following text: 'Understand what causes React to render'. Let me know if you need any further assistance."
"How to move business logic into reusable hooks" seems to be a topic of interest. Can you please provide me with more context so that I can better understand what you're looking for?
While the core concepts I mentioned are usually best understood by actively coding and making React projects, intermediate concepts require an understanding of how React works.

Fortunately, you can get all of that understanding through reading the all-new [React documentation](https://react.dev/). There are several very helpful guides covering these intermediate and sometimes advanced concepts.

## Vite

![Vite](/images/react-roadmap-2024/vite.webp)

React is unopinionated and requires third-party libraries for essential functionality in single-page applications.

To create a new React app in 2024, I’d highly recommend using the CLI/build tool Vite..
You can use NPM to create a React application with all the necessary tools for development and production.

```bash
npm create vite@latest my-react-app -- --template react
```

Create React App is no longer recommended. It’s not being as actively maintained and is far slower than Vite.

## TanStack Query

![Query](/images/react-roadmap-2024/tanstack-query.webp)

Data fetching out of the box in React applications is complex. Without a dedicated library, you need to resort to performing HTTP requests in the useEffect hook.

However, this requires adding a lot of additional boilerplate code to manage loading and error state, and it doesn’t handle a lot of logic to prevent making unnecessary requests.

The go-to library I’d recommend for any React or Next.js application would be TanStack Query (previously known as React Query).

It provides simple hooks to not only request but also to “mutate” (update) data from an API endpoint.

It includes features such as caching, deduplication of multiple requests, and ensuring data is up-to-date, making it a versatile and customizable data-fetching library.

## Application State with Zustand

![Zustand](/images/react-roadmap-2024/zustand.webp)

State management libraries are necessary for React applications when you get to a specific size project. The default state management library for React applications for a long time has been Redux, and has been improved with Redux Toolkit.

That allows you to describe your state as an object and write functions to update properties on that state object. The go-to state management library for the past couple of years for me has been Zustand.

There are many good alternatives to Zustand such as Recoil and Jotai, both of which share a similar API to Zustand.

## TailwindCSS and Radix

![ShadCDN](/images/react-roadmap-2024/shad.webp)

There are tons of styling options for React in the form of component libraries. These are premade sets of components that not only offer an excellent, consistent design but built-in functionality as well.

A better alternative for 2024 that many developers and businesses are moving towards is using a solution like Tailwind CSS. It allows you to style your components with chainable, premade classes in combination with a minimal component library, such as Radix.

Radix offers a set of building blocks called primitives that enable you to create highly functional components for your application. These components include dialogs, buttons, selects, tooltips, and numerous other elements that can be customized to suit your needs. You can also style them in any way you prefer.

ShadCN UI is a set of components that uses both TailwindCSS and Radix components and provides a good starting place for any application. You can also customize it more than a traditional component library.

I’d highly recommend using something like ShadCN UI for React projects that you use in 2024.

If you want to use a component library instead, some good choices are Mantine, Chakra UI, and Material UI.

## TanStack Router

![Router](/images/react-roadmap-2024/tanstack-router.webp)

React Router still remains the go-to router for most React applications you will build.

React Router has been around since the beginning of React and continues to receive significant updates with React Router 6. Its thorough documentation covers virtually any use case you can imagine.

One crucial alternative, however, is TanStack Router.

It’s a brand-new router for 2024 with a plethora of great features. It has type-safe navigation, built-in TypeScript support, nested routing, and automatic route prefetching, and is designed for use with client-side data fetching libraries like TanStack Query and SWR.

If you’re using TanStack Query, I’d highly recommend checking out TanStack Router for future React projects.

## React Hook Form

![Forms](/images/react-roadmap-2024/react-hook-form.webp)

Form libraries are not always necessary when building React apps. But if you need form validation, a highly customizable and straightforward choice is React Hook Form.
With the built-in `useForm` hook, it makes it very easy to customize the input validation and the error messages.
What’s great about React Hook Form is that there’s very little code to add to your components. Most of it is abstracted in the useForm hook itself.

Some other reliable alternatives that might include a bit more code to setup are Formik and Final Form.

## Next.js

![Next.js](/images/react-roadmap-2024/nextjs.webp)

Choosing a full-stack React framework is perhaps the most crucial decision when building a React project.
These frameworks allow you to create both the React client and server side, where you can build APIs and add authentication.
The most popular React framework is Next.js, and for good reason.

Next.js 13 gave us server components, which allow us to run our React code on the server. This reduces the amount of JavaScript sent to our client, making for an overall better and faster user experience.

We can use a technique to retrieve data from the server and integrate it into our React component during the first render. This way, we can avoid showing loading spinners and provide a seamless single-page application experience.

Although Next.js comes with a lot of patterns that may seem to conflict with the core concepts of React, it's done with the intention of making your life easier as a React developer and building faster. However, there is a downside to it.

An excellent alternative to Next.js is Remix, which will soon adopt server components.
